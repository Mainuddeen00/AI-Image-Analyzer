AI Image Analyzer


A serverless AI-powered web app that analyzes images using AWS Rekognition, auto-generates labels and object data, and displays results with a modern UI.

Live Demo
Upload any image, and see AI-detected labels and bounding boxes in real time!

Features
Secure Uploads: Pre-signed URLs via API Gateway & Lambda

Serverless Backend: AWS Lambda triggers Rekognition and stores results

Real-Time Analysis: View detected objects, faces, and confidence scores

Clean UI: Dark-themed responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JS

Fully Cloud-Hosted: S3 for storage, Vercel for frontend hosting

How It Works
Frontend â†’ Requests a pre-signed S3 upload URL via API Gateway.

User Upload â†’ File uploads securely to input/ folder in S3.

S3 Event â†’ Automatically triggers DetectImageLabels Lambda.

AWS Rekognition â†’ Detects labels, objects, faces, and confidence.

Lambda â†’ Saves results JSON to results/ folder in S3.

Frontend â†’ Fetches and displays the labels with a clean UI.

Local Development
This project is 100% serverless â€” no local server needed.
You can update & redeploy:

Frontend: Deploy to Vercel (1-click)

Backend: Manage Lambda, S3, and API Gateway in the AWS Console
